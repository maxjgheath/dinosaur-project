            <h2>The Dinosaur Project</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the website for the Dinosaur Project! This is an
                informational website dedicated to educating the public about the
                ancient dinosaurs, some of the most unique and majestic creatures to
                ever roam the earth. On the site, you can learn more about
                about Tyrannosaurus Rex and Triceratops, two of the most famous
                dinosaurs, participate in a survey about the popularity of dinosaurs
                around the world, and view the data on the survey's results that the
                Dinosaur Project has gathered so far.

            <h3>Why Learn About Dinosaurs?</h3>
            <p>
                Although the last true dinosaurs died out many millions of years in
                the Earth's past, there are many compelling reasons to learn about
                dinosaurs. Dinosaurs have a unique and fascinating biology unlike that of
                any other group of animal, and their influence on popular culture is extremely
                widespread, so such knowledge does not go to waste.

            <h3>Survey</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of the Dinosaur Project's survey is to determine whether certain
                dinosaur clades are more popular in certain regions of the globe, or if
                geographic origin has no significant correlation with preference for dinosaurs.
                If you want to participate, navigate to the survey page and fill out the form.
