            <h2>Tyrannosaurus Rex</h2>
            <h3>The 'Tyrant Lizard King'</h3>
            <p>
                Tyrannosaurus Rex, sometimes called T-Rex, is one of the most famous and culturally
                influential of all animals, with an image that is immediately recognizable to anyone
                with even passing knowledge of dinosaurs. This species' scientific name translates from
                Latin to 'Tyrant Lizard King,' and its reputation lives up to that name. Scientists have
                studied T-Rex since it was first discovered in 1905, and in that period, they have learned
                a great deal about this ancient creature's biology and behavior.

            <h3>Diet and Feeding</h3>
            <p>
                T-Rex was one of the largest land carnivores to ever exist, but contrary to popular belief,
                it was not exclusively predatory. Many scientists believe that Tyrannosaurus Rex was a scavenger
                that fed on carrion in addition to killing its own prey. The dinosaur employed its tremendous
                bite strength and large teeth to break up the bones of a carcass so more food could be obtained.
                Tyrannosaurus Rex was an apex predator capable of consuming any other dinosaur in its territory.
